# 🔧 Database Region Fix Applied

## Issue Identified
Your Firebase Realtime Database is in the **Asia Southeast region**, but the code was pointing to the default US region.

## What Was Fixed

### ✅ Updated `firebase-config.js`
**Old URL (WRONG):**
```javascript
databaseURL: "https://icct-store-29ea5-default-rtdb.firebaseio.com"
```

**New URL (CORRECT):**
```javascript
databaseURL: "https://icct-store-29ea5-default-rtdb.asia-southeast1.firebasedatabase.app"
```

## 🚀 How to Fix Your Products Issue

### Step 1: Upload Products to Firebase
1. Open the file: `upload-products-asia.html` in your browser
2. Click **"🔍 Check Existing Products"** to see if you have any products
3. If no products found, click **"🚀 Upload All Products to Firebase"**
4. Wait for: `✅ Upload Complete! Successfully uploaded 31 products to Firebase`

### Step 2: Test Your Website
1. Open `index.html` in your browser
2. Open browser console (F12)
3. Click any category (e.g., "Uniforms")
4. You should see:
   ```
   🔥 Loading products from Firebase for category: uniforms
   ✅ Loaded 8 products from Firebase
   ```
5. Products should now display! 🎉

## Console Commands to Verify

Open your browser console and run:

```javascript
// Check if Firebase is initialized
console.log('Database URL:', firebase.database().ref().toString());

// Should show: https://icct-store-29ea5-default-rtdb.asia-southeast1.firebasedatabase.app/

// Check for products
firebase.database().ref('products').once('value').then(snapshot => {
    console.log('Products:', snapshot.val());
});
```

## Why This Happened

Firebase databases can be created in different regions:
- **US (Default)**: `firebaseio.com`
- **Europe**: `europe-west1.firebasedatabase.app`
- **Asia**: `asia-southeast1.firebasedatabase.app`

Your database was created in **Asia Southeast**, so the URL must match that region.

## Still Not Working?

### Check Firebase Console Rules
1. Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/icct-store-29ea5/database/rules
2. Set temporary rules (for testing):
   ```json
   {
     "rules": {
       ".read": true,
       ".write": true
     }
   }
   ```
3. Click "Publish"

### Clear Browser Cache
1. Press `Ctrl + Shift + Delete` (or `Cmd + Shift + Delete` on Mac)
2. Clear cached images and files
3. Reload page with `Ctrl + F5`

## Expected Result

After uploading products, your database should look like this:

```
products/
  ├── uniform-male/ → Stock: 45
  ├── uniform-female/ → Stock: 38
  ├── pe-uniform/ → Stock: 60
  └── ... (31 products total)
```

And your website should display all products by category! 🎉

## Status: ✅ FIXED

The database URL is now correct. Just need to upload products using `upload-products-asia.html`.
