# Payment Ledger Feature - Admin Panel

## ✅ Feature Overview

Added a comprehensive payment ledger to the admin panel that tracks total revenue received from each payment method separately, providing clear financial visibility for administrators.

## 🎯 What Was Added

### 1. Payment Ledger Summary Dashboard
A visual dashboard at the top of the Payment Management section showing:
- **Individual Method Cards**: 4 separate cards for each payment method
- **Total Revenue Card**: Combined earnings from all methods
- **Real-time Updates**: Automatically recalculates when payment statuses change

### 2. Payment Methods Tracked

| Payment Method | Icon | Color Theme |
|----------------|------|-------------|
| **GCash** | 📱 Mobile | Blue (#007aff) |
| **ECPay** | 🏪 Store | Orange (#ff6b35) |
| **M Lhuillier** | 💵 Money | Green (#28a745) |
| **Cebuana Lhuillier** | 🏛️ Bank | Yellow (#ffc107) |

### 3. Ledger Cards Display

Each card shows:
- ✅ **Payment Method Name**
- ✅ **Total Amount Received** (formatted as ₱X,XXX.XX)
- ✅ **Transaction Count** (number of successful payments)
- ✅ **Visual Icon** representing the payment method
- ✅ **Color-coded Border** for easy identification

### 4. Total Revenue Card

Special full-width card showing:
- 💰 **Total Revenue** from all payment methods combined
- 📊 **Total Transaction Count** across all methods
- 🌟 **Highlighted Styling** with gold accents
- 📈 **Prominent Display** for quick reference

## 💻 Technical Implementation

### HTML Structure (index.html)
```html
<div class="payment-ledger-container">
    <h2 class="ledger-title"><i class="fas fa-coins"></i> Payment Ledger Summary</h2>
    <div class="ledger-grid">
        <!-- 4 Payment Method Cards -->
        <!-- 1 Total Revenue Card -->
    </div>
</div>
```

### JavaScript Calculation (script.js)
```javascript
// Calculate ledger totals (only count 'Paid' transactions)
const ledger = {
    gcash: { total: 0, count: 0 },
    ecpay: { total: 0, count: 0 },
    mlhuillier: { total: 0, count: 0 },
    cebuana: { total: 0, count: 0 }
};

dummyPayments.forEach(payment => {
    if (payment.status === 'Paid') {
        // Add to appropriate method total
    }
});

updateLedgerDisplay(ledger, totalRevenue, totalCount);
```

### Important Logic
- **Only 'Paid' transactions are counted** in ledger totals
- 'Pending' and 'Failed' payments are excluded from revenue
- Totals update automatically when payment status changes
- Currency formatting: ₱X,XXX.XX (Philippine Peso)

## 📊 Sample Data

### Current Ledger State (12 transactions):

| Method | Amount | Transactions |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| **GCash** | ₱5,680.00 | 4 payments |
| **ECPay** | ₱2,545.00 | 3 payments |
| **M Lhuillier** | ₱4,920.00 | 2 payments |
| **Cebuana Lhuillier** | ₱3,580.00 | 2 payments |
| **TOTAL** | ₱16,725.00 | 11 paid transactions |

*Note: 1 transaction is "Pending" so not included in totals*

## 🎨 Visual Design

### Card Layout
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ ═══ (Color Bar at top)             │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│  [Icon]   GCASH                    │
│   📱      ₱5,680.00                │
│           4 transactions            │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Responsive Design
- **Desktop (>1200px)**: All 5 cards in one row
- **Tablet (768px-1200px)**: 2 cards per row
- **Mobile (<768px)**: 1 card per row (stacked)
- Total card always spans full width on all sizes

### Hover Effects
- Card lifts up slightly (translateY: -5px)
- Blue glow shadow appears
- Border color becomes visible
- Smooth 0.3s transition

## 🔄 Auto-Update Behavior

The ledger automatically updates when:
1. ✅ Admin changes payment status from Pending → Paid
2. ✅ Admin changes payment status from Paid → Failed
3. ✅ Admin changes payment status from Failed → Paid
4. ✅ Page loads or refreshes
5. ✅ Admin navigates to Payments section

### Update Example:
```
Payment #PAY002 (₱850.00 ECPay) changes:
Pending → Paid

Before:
ECPay: ₱1,695.00 (2 transactions)
Total: ₱15,875.00

After:
ECPay: ₱2,545.00 (3 transactions) ⬆️ +₱850
Total: ₱16,725.00 ⬆️ +₱850
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Ledger Display:
1. Login as admin (user: `admin`, pass: `admin123`)
2. Navigate to "Payments" tab
3. Verify ledger appears at top of page
4. Check all 4 payment methods show totals
5. Verify total revenue matches sum of all methods

### Test Auto-Update:
1. Find a "Pending" payment in the table
2. Change its status to "Paid"
3. Observe ledger cards update immediately
4. Verify amount and count increase correctly
5. Change status back to "Pending"
6. Verify amount and count decrease

### Test Different Methods:
