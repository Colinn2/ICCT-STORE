2. Navigate to `products/`

4. Look at the `category` field

### Check in Browser Console
```javascript
// Run this in your browser console
firebase.database().ref('products').once('value').then(snapshot => {
    const products = snapshot.val();
    const categories = {};
    Object.values(products).forEach(p => {
        categories[p.category] = (categories[p.category] || 0) + 1;
    });
    console.log('Categories found:', categories);
});
```

## 🐛 Still Not Working?

### Issue: "Fix button doesn't work"
**Solution:** Check Firebase database rules
```json
{
  "rules": {
    ".read": true,
    ".write": true
  }
}
```

### Issue: "Categories fixed but still no products"
**Solution:** Hard refresh your website
- Windows: `Ctrl + F5`
- Mac: `Cmd + Shift + R`

### Issue: "Images still missing"
**Solution:** Make sure image files exist in `/images` folder
- Image paths should be: `images/product-name.jpg`
- Check if files actually exist in your `/images` folder
